### Old Standard

Open-source fonts by Alexey Kryukov

The Old Standard font family is an attempt to revive a specific type of
Modern (classicist) style of serif typefaces, very commonly used in various
editions printed in the late 19th and early 20th century, but almost
completely  abandoned later. Although contemporary typographers often
consider this lettertype obsolete and out-of-fashion, it still has at least
two advantages:

* The classicist style still can be considered a good choice for
typesetting scientific papers, especially on social and humanitarian
sciences, as its specific features are closely associated in the people's
eyes with old books they learned on;

* the most beautiful examples of Greek and Cyrillic lettertypes were all
based on the Modern style, so that for those scripts "Modern" fonts
are much more appropriate than any contemporary (e. g. Times-based)
designs.

That's why the Old Standard font family has two main purposes: it is
intended to be used as a specialized font for philologists (mainly
classicists, germanists and slavists) and also as a general-purpose font
for typesetting various  editions in languages which use Greek or Cyrillic
script. For this reason Old Standard provides glyphs for a wide range of
Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters.

The name "Old Standard" was selected as opposed to the "Obyknovennaya
Novaya" ("New Standard") typeface, widely used in the Soviet typography,
which represents another, slightly different type of the same Modern style.
The digital version of this font is now available from Paratype
(http://www.paratype.ru). Of course this name doesn't look very original,
but it seems to be a good choice for a revival of the most common
lettertype of the early 20th century.
